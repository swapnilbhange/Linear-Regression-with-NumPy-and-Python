# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python

In this project, you will do all the machine learning __without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels.__ The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms yourself, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

---

### In this Project you will

- Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch

- Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python

- Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib
---

### Following steps are performed

- Load the Data and Libraries

- Visualize the Data

- Compute the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃)

- Gradient Descent

- Visualize the Cost Function 𝐽(𝜃)

- Plot the Convergence

- Training Data with Univariate Linear Regression Fit

- Inference using the optimized 𝜃 values
